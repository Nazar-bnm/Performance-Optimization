            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
                describing the presentation of a document written in a markup 
                language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web 
                pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language 
                can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and 
                XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. 
                Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology 
                used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user 
                interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many 
                mobile applications.</p>
            <p>CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document 
                content from document presentation, including aspects such as 
                the layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve 
                content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in 
                the specification of presentation characteristics, enable 
                multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the 
                relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity 
                and repetition in the structural content, such as semantically 
                insignificant tables that were widely used to format pages 
                before consistent CSS rendering was available in all major 
                browsers. CSS makes it possible to separate presentation 
                instructions from the HTML content in a separate file or style 
                section of the HTML file. For each matching HTML element, it 
                provides a list of formatting instructions. For example, a CSS 
                rule might specify that "all heading 1 elements should be bold", 
                leaving pure semantic HTML markup that asserts "this text is a 
                level 1 heading" without formatting code such as a  &lt;bold&gt; 
                tag indicating how such text should be displayed.</p>
            <p>This separation of formatting and content makes it possible to 
                present the same markup page in different styles for different 
                rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice 
                (when read out by a speech-based browser or screen reader) and 
                on Braille-based, tactile devices. It can also be used to 
                display the web page differently depending on the screen size 
                or device on which it is being viewed. Although the author of 
                a web page typically links to a CSS file within the markup file, 
                readers can specify a different style sheet, such as a CSS file 
                stored on their own computer, to override the one the author 
                has specified. If the author or the reader did not link the 
                document to a style sheet, the default style of the browser 
                will be applied. Another advantage of CSS is that aesthetic 
                changes to the graphic design of a document (or hundreds of 
                documents) can be applied quickly and easily, by editing 
                a few lines in one file, rather than by a laborious (and 
                thus expensive) process of crawling over every document line 
                by line, changing markup.</p>
            <p>The CSS specification describes a priority scheme to determine 
                which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against 
                a particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities 
                (or weights) are calculated and assigned to rules, so that the 
                results are predictable.</p>
            <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web 
                Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css 
                is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). 
                The W3C operates a free CSS validation service 
                for CSS documents.</p>
